# Student Management System
A simple Student Management System built with FastAPI and MongoDB for managing student data, including operations like creating, updating, deleting, and retrieving students' information. This system features schema validation with Pydantic and efficient database interactions using PyMongo.

## Features
- Create a new student with server-side generated student IDs.
- Retrieve student records by MongoDB Object ID or custom student ID.
- Update and delete student records by custom student ID.
- Input validation (e.g., age, phone number, email) using Pydantic models.
- Program and department validation to ensure consistency.
- MongoDB for data storage and retrieval.
- Automatic timestamps for created and updated records.
